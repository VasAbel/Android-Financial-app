# Financial freedom

## The project

It is a university project where the task was to create an own android program with 3 pages and using learnt technologies.

My app is a financial register where we can save our expenses in different categories. We can inspect the spent money on diagrams separated by categories or summarized, and we can also set boundaries which if we exceed, the application sends a warning.   

## Main functions

We can add and delete products with their prices to/from a list.

We have 3 buttons to choose if we want to see the list, the diagram, or the boundary setting page. 

Elements of the list and the set boundaries are stored even after the app is restarted.

We can switch between the categorized and the summarized diagrams on the diagram page.

The summarized boundary is automatically calculated as the sum of the categories' individual boundaries.

## Used technologies:

- UI
- fragments
- RecyclerView
